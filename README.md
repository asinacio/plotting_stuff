python_plots.py is the script that I copied from docDB 5076; there is also an image with the output


the other two scripts are mostly building on top of that: I set the global parameters in the same way (but modified them a bit because I thought it would look nicer),
added a color map, specified a few things for different plot types (hist, scatter, .....) and also included images with the outputs for the examples given in these

I added a doc with color blind friendly suggestions for plots as a reference

Also added an image that highlights the differences between the script that writes things on plots in times new roman and the one that writes in sans serif

Still need to organize things nicely and write instructions for using template
