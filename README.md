This repo contains three files with plotting templates: one for C/Root, two for python (one using Times New Roman, one using Sans Serif). Need slightly different code for using different fonts because TNR doesn't really exist in matplotlib, so we need to give it a separate font file and modify the code a bit

Have a look at the script that matches your needs :)
